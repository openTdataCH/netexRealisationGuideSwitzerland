## View

In this profile, "View" is used in two complementary senses:

1. **Publication view** - The way data is selected and packaged inside a NeTEx PublicationDelivery for a specific purpose or audience (e.g., a Timetable publication view).
2. **Thematic view** - A conceptual grouping used in the profile to scope content and requirements (e.g., Timetable, Network, Fares).

Clarifications:
- DatedCalls are not a separate "view" - they are child elements of a DatedServiceJourney within a TimetableFrame.
- When in doubt, prefer the precise NeTEx model terms (PublicationDelivery, TimetableFrame, DatedServiceJourney).
